You are given four C++ source files.
1. Array.cpp
2. Stack.cpp
3. Queue.cpp
4. Main.cpp

You are also given two other files.
1. Main.exe
2. MainOutput.txt

The Main.cpp file contains the complete main method. You need to add code to Array.cpp, Stack.cpp, and Queue.cpp files to achieve the required output shown in MainOutput.txt. You can also run the Main.exe file to see the output. The necessary comments and restrictions are provided in the C++ source files. You are not allowed to change the Main.cpp file.
