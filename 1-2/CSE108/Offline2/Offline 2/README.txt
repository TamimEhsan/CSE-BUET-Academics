You are given two C++ source files.
1. Container.cpp
2. ContainerArray.cpp

You are also given two other files.
1. ContainerArray.exe
2. output.txt

You need to add code to Container.cpp and ContainerArray.cpp files to achieve the required output shown in output.txt. You can also run the ContainerArray.exe file to see the output (will be the same as the output.txt). Note that, it is not necessary to print the output in a file (the output.txt file is provided only for your convenience). The necessary comments and restrictions are provided in the C++ source files. You are not allowed to change the main method in the ContainerArray.cpp file.
